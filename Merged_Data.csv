* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion.

A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).

Yes, it's not perfect. Yes, management is not perfect. Yes, some people have been burned in the past, which is why they're taking it out on the company and on the CEO, whose stern and very matter-of-fact personality can be difficult to get used to. 

However, since this is the pros section, I will focus only on the pros.

1) My colleagues and the employees at TCL are amazing. They are some of the kindest, most humble people I have ever met. No one is a huge jerk. There's no one-upping. There's no showboating. There's generally no ego. Everyone is very willing to work with each other. There is a profound sense of family and belonging. It is also a very diverse crowd in terms of race, gender, and age, which is something we're definitely proud of.

2) It is one of the best companies for a young person to be in, or for a person that wants to make a huge impact. While this company has some of the biggest clients in the world, it is considered a small enterprise. The headquarters in LA has only about a few dozen people. And a company that generates over 50M a year in revenue is going to rely heavily on everyone. Naturally, this is a great company for someone young, as you learn really important skills in the business world that you cannot experience or learn in a bigger company with a more refined and smaller role where you do the same task over and over.

3) Lax work environment. This must seem confusing to you, especially if you've read that upper management can be very pressuring. However, generally, the work here is not deadline driven. It's more work-at-your-own-pace-but-make-sure-the-pace-is-reasonable. Especially if you're new and young, it's a pretty accommodating work flow and environment that you can easily adapt to, whatever your ideal work style is.","1) Lack of structure. This one is brought up a lot. And there is some truth to it. There is some lack of hierarchy, but the advantage of that is the fluidity of it. This company doesn't operate bureaucratically. You don't have to go to one person to speak to another person. You can just.. go to them for your questions and answers. And I think a lot of people who are tired of the ham-fisted bureaucratic and corporate cultures of big companies will find some relief here.

2) Upper management only speaks Korean. They can definitely understand English, and many of them speak English, but the communication barrier exists, and that can make communication less efficient. It's not a huge deal, but some things do get lost in translation. 

3) Benefits are okay at best. Sales does have a pretty decent incentives program, but I'm not too fond of the cheap health insurance.",4.0,Peter Yu,CEO,0.0,0.0,,,,

However, this directly contradicts your Maternity Leave policy. Currently, expecting mothers are offered ZERO paid time off. The only Leave of Absence (LOA) options are those that are mandated by state. 

When expecting mothers take this LOA, they are required to use the entirety of their Paid Time Off (PTO) bank, and this “bank” will not refresh until the associate hits their anniversary date. In some cases, if the baby is born soon after the mother’s anniversary date, they will not be able to utilize ANY paid time off for the next 9 or 10 months (because they used it all by requirement during their LOA). In addition, Omni only recognizes 6 paid holidays, and no “sick” days, so mothers who return from LOA must take unpaid time off to spend additional time with families during holiday seasons.

Consequently, mothers who take this unpaid LOA will not accrue PTO during this time. They are punished for taking unpaid time off… while caring for their newborn baby. When their anniversary hits, they will receive a significantly less amount of PTO than a coworker with the same anniversary date who did not take an LOA. 

I am a high performing manager for Omni Hotels and I truly enjoy my job. However, the blatant disrespect for expecting mothers has caused me to begin my job search. As I begin to think about starting a family, this is something I cannot ignore. I’ve seen multiple coworkers who are new mothers personally struggle with this policy.

For a debt-free company who loudly boasts a “valued family member” atmosphere, Maternity Leave should be at the forefront of the corporate office. There is no better way to show that you care about families than to offer this. As a foundation of our culture, we are taught that our opinion matters & that feedback is welcomed.

2. Quality is extremely low. Sometimes I felt like I was working at McDonalds and not a professional services firm. The emphasis is on getting through work as fast as possible and expectations for quality are not realistic.
3. EY has a very hard time firing bad employees. If you get stuck with one it can be a nightmare.
4.  EY has a heavy emphasis on wasting time. For example, there are lots and lots of checklists which have no value that you have to  fill out. Also, they wasted money and time on creating ""Canvas"" which is literally slower and more awkward than the previous workspace tool, GAMX. There is a heavy emphasis on ""reinventing the wheel"" and fixing problems  that aren't broken with even worse solutions. Instead of wasting money on useless tools, that money could have been spent on your employees in the  form of compensation. Like I said, EY is really focused on attempting to look as though value is being created when in fact it is not. 
5. Lots of meetings. Appearances are very important.
6. Employees on global 360 accounts get better treatment.
7. Some employees (executives mostly) tend to overemphasize how important this work is. Let's face it, if it was really glorious work then we would have action figures. 
8. Looks are very important. Seriously, if you are a girl, you will get promoted based on how hot you are (the quality of your work is largely unimportant). If you are a guy, you are treated a little better but there is still a sexist undercurrent in the environment. This is advice you won't get from HR obviously, but that doesn't mean it isn't true.
8.  You will be forced to eat hours.
9. Your ethical compass will start to get weaker.
10. You will get a little cynical.
11. Lots of driving and travel.
12. ""Family men"" and married couples with children are more likely to be promoted. If you want to be a partner, you have to be married (few exceptions).
13. You will work on vacations.
14. Loss of relationships with family and friends.
15. Some backstabbing and credit-stealing (but not very common).
16. Comp is below market but that's to be expected.
17. Employee retention is not something management is interested in. This makes you replaceable and expendable (yes even as a manager, unless you have been ""designated"" as a high performer by the partner group).",5.0,Carmine Di  Sibio,Global Chairman and CEO,451.0,95.0,https://media.glassdoor.com/people/sqll/2784/ey-ceo1567010297056.png,,,
