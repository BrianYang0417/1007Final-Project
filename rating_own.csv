I'm going to give you a problem that neither the CEO nor his entire management team could solve.  And I'm probably going to give you lots of different opinions and imperfect data sources.  And then I'll ask you to focus in on where the most value is and convince all those people with different opinions that you're right.  But don't worry, I'm also going to give you a Bain team.  Those associates and consultants are going to be tenacious in coming up with creative approaches.  Those managers and partners are going to knock down barriers for you, connect you where you need to be connected, guide, support, direct and re-direct you.  The office support staff is going to fix your computer after you spilled coffee on it for the third time, find you the unfindable data source, and smile and hand you a baked good after you ask for help re-doing dozens of slides.  You are empowered and accountable but you are not alone.  And the best part is you can't fail.  Because after all, what all those people are reinforcing is that a Bainie never lets another Bainie fail.","Here's how you know you've made it at Bain.  The reward for doing a good job is getting a bigger, tougher problem next time.  Meaning, you are always solving the easiest problem you will ever solve again.  This takes a lot of resilience and active managing of self-expectations to remember that you are not actually getting worse, the problems are just getting harder.  So my advice is to remember that.  And then take a second to realize that it would be a lot less fun if the reverse were true.  And isn't that precisely why you wanted this job in the first place anyway?

It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.",5.0,Sundar Pichai,CEO,4118.0,91.0,https://media.glassdoor.com/people/sqll/9079/google-sundar-pichai.png,,,

Besides the great policies, HubSpot's best perk is the people. Diversity of experience is vital to self-improvement and HubSpot provides this through all of the incredible people you get to work with. Most HubSpotters have experienced something in their life that makes them ""Shiny"".  Our mystery dinners align us with people and an executive host that we usually wouldn't run into; after a few minutes you may learn that the colleague to your right had played professional baseball player and the women sitting in front of you was a detective in a past life. The growth you experience at HubSpot is gained through hard work (HubSpot is a challenging environment) and an openmind to other perspectives. Here's some other things that are cool:

1. Waffle Wednesday
2. Best nitro cold brew coffee ever
3. Silos of Cashews
4. Stock plan
5. Great health insurance; hubspot covers the vast majority of your deductible. 
6. Dogs at work
7. The gym
8. Awesome headphones (I can't go back)
9. Free tickets to science museum
10. Free tickets to museum of fine art
11. Free Kindle book of your choice every 2 weeks (UGJ)
12. Cereal buffet
13. Great selection of local beers
14. Nap room 
15. Meditation room (HubSpot can be challenging)
16. Peanut M&M's 
17. Awesome speakers for HubTalks and Fireside chats.
18. INBOUND(a week of Ted talks on steroids with trays of ðŸ¦ž rolls to end the night).
19. #Catspotting slack channel 
20. Making a quantifiable impact on our customers bottom line.
21. Helping the world automate tedious tasks (aka work smarter not harder).","If you think hubspot is the cure-all for your current work woes; you're gonna have a bad time.

This company is run by micromanagers who care very little about employees and instead hire their friends who shouldn't be in the positions that are given to them. They gossip all day so watch out. 

Hostile work environment. You aren't even allowed to talk to other employees, at all. Period. While the family and their WORKING FAMILY FRIENDS will walk around and talk and do personal business all day every day. Nepotism is how this company is run. Terrible terrible work environment.  The owners are on some power trip and are the least humble people I've ever met. When news flash, you own a window cleaning supply company, not an NFL team. DO NOT WORK HERE. You will be taken advantage of, and not treated fairly. They are hard on you about things that don't really matter overall, and then go on and treat their good employees with such disrespect. I cannot believe I worked here as long as I did. In the end they didn't care about me as an employee.

EVERY employee they had at the time I worked with them thought this family was ridiculous. (Except for the family and their family friends of course)

No commute, no child care, no savvy business clothes, no commuting in the snow, and the best part is every day is ""bring your cat to work day!"" My cat, Bootsie, loves my job as much as I do! No kidding, I've had parents post reviews on my cat! The kids love it! Payment is once a month. I don't mind that because then it its a big check. You know what to expect and money is in the account on time. I love the children I teach. It is amazing how close you get to the family from the other side of the world!","You'll read that there is not enough work. I don't think that is accurate. I've been with VIPKID going on six months. My first contract is at an end. My first month I made $55.00. The next month I more than doubled that, and every month after has been going higher and higher. I am now teaching about five hours a day and making very good money for wearing pajama bottoms and an orange t-shirt. My monthly is in the four figure range. The thing is you have to give the parents a reason to schedule with you. Sitting around waiting for bookings to come is not good. You won't get far teaching only trial students; although, trial students become regular students and they will remember your smiling face. The trick to getting more bookings is to take advantages of their certifications in different areas. In November I got certified to do the major courses and my schedule is now completely and totally packed. I literally have a very full schedule, teaching around eleven classes a day. You hear a lot of complaints about missing classes. When you teach, even at a school, attendance is important. As far as online schools go, VIPKID is the most liberal. I could have worked with DaDaAbc and made a lot more money. Their attendance policy is HORRENDOUS! You are locked into a schedule that will not vary, cannot travel. I have two homes and I could only teach at one. My travel was stopped. VIPKID encourages their teachers to live a life. Its great stories for the kids. When I am at my place in Brooklyn, they are pretty amazed to see NYC.

Yes, it's not perfect. Yes, management is not perfect. Yes, some people have been burned in the past, which is why they're taking it out on the company and on the CEO, whose stern and very matter-of-fact personality can be difficult to get used to. 

However, since this is the pros section, I will focus only on the pros.

1) My colleagues and the employees at TCL are amazing. They are some of the kindest, most humble people I have ever met. No one is a huge jerk. There's no one-upping. There's no showboating. There's generally no ego. Everyone is very willing to work with each other. There is a profound sense of family and belonging. It is also a very diverse crowd in terms of race, gender, and age, which is something we're definitely proud of.

2) It is one of the best companies for a young person to be in, or for a person that wants to make a huge impact. While this company has some of the biggest clients in the world, it is considered a small enterprise. The headquarters in LA has only about a few dozen people. And a company that generates over 50M a year in revenue is going to rely heavily on everyone. Naturally, this is a great company for someone young, as you learn really important skills in the business world that you cannot experience or learn in a bigger company with a more refined and smaller role where you do the same task over and over.

3) Lax work environment. This must seem confusing to you, especially if you've read that upper management can be very pressuring. However, generally, the work here is not deadline driven. It's more work-at-your-own-pace-but-make-sure-the-pace-is-reasonable. Especially if you're new and young, it's a pretty accommodating work flow and environment that you can easily adapt to, whatever your ideal work style is.","1) Lack of structure. This one is brought up a lot. And there is some truth to it. There is some lack of hierarchy, but the advantage of that is the fluidity of it. This company doesn't operate bureaucratically. You don't have to go to one person to speak to another person. You can just.. go to them for your questions and answers. And I think a lot of people who are tired of the ham-fisted bureaucratic and corporate cultures of big companies will find some relief here.

2) Upper management only speaks Korean. They can definitely understand English, and many of them speak English, but the communication barrier exists, and that can make communication less efficient. It's not a huge deal, but some things do get lost in translation. 

3) Benefits are okay at best. Sales does have a pretty decent incentives program, but I'm not too fond of the cheap health insurance.",4.0,Peter Yu,CEO,0.0,0.0,,,,

However, this directly contradicts your Maternity Leave policy. Currently, expecting mothers are offered ZERO paid time off. The only Leave of Absence (LOA) options are those that are mandated by state. 

When expecting mothers take this LOA, they are required to use the entirety of their Paid Time Off (PTO) bank, and this “bank” will not refresh until the associate hits their anniversary date. In some cases, if the baby is born soon after the mother’s anniversary date, they will not be able to utilize ANY paid time off for the next 9 or 10 months (because they used it all by requirement during their LOA). In addition, Omni only recognizes 6 paid holidays, and no “sick” days, so mothers who return from LOA must take unpaid time off to spend additional time with families during holiday seasons.

Consequently, mothers who take this unpaid LOA will not accrue PTO during this time. They are punished for taking unpaid time off… while caring for their newborn baby. When their anniversary hits, they will receive a significantly less amount of PTO than a coworker with the same anniversary date who did not take an LOA. 

I am a high performing manager for Omni Hotels and I truly enjoy my job. However, the blatant disrespect for expecting mothers has caused me to begin my job search. As I begin to think about starting a family, this is something I cannot ignore. I’ve seen multiple coworkers who are new mothers personally struggle with this policy.

For a debt-free company who loudly boasts a “valued family member” atmosphere, Maternity Leave should be at the forefront of the corporate office. There is no better way to show that you care about families than to offer this. As a foundation of our culture, we are taught that our opinion matters & that feedback is welcomed. Please consider changing your policy.",5.0,Peter Strebel,President,672.0,97.0,https://media.glassdoor.com/people/sqll/19022/omni-hotels-ceo1545888269452.png,,,

You will have a very hard time not falling in love with every single person you meet there.
2. Seriously, you will meet your soul mate(s) there.
3. Prestigious and looks great on the resume.
4. Your brain will grow a thousand times more powerful.
5. Forces you to conquer your fear of public speaking.
6. Fun team bonding and lifelong friends.
7. Stepping stone to high paying jobs.
8. Helps you work on perfecting your charm. You will learn from the most charming people how to really get people to like you.
9. HR really cares.
10. Big support network (IT, creative services, etc.).
11. Teaches you to be calm and in control.","OK, I'm going to be discussing all the taboo things, and there are a lot of them. In spite of these cons, I still admit it's worth a five star rating. 
1. High performers are ""designated"" (you have very little control over your rating) by the partner group (can be a pro if you get selected. Seriously, I have worked with some of the supposed ""fives"" and they are not any different than my threes and fours.
2. Quality is extremely low. Sometimes I felt like I was working at McDonalds and not a professional services firm. The emphasis is on getting through work as fast as possible and expectations for quality are not realistic.
3. EY has a very hard time firing bad employees. If you get stuck with one it can be a nightmare.
4.  EY has a heavy emphasis on wasting time. For example, there are lots and lots of checklists which have no value that you have to  fill out. Also, they wasted money and time on creating ""Canvas"" which is literally slower and more awkward than the previous workspace tool, GAMX. There is a heavy emphasis on ""reinventing the wheel"" and fixing problems  that aren't broken with even worse solutions. Instead of wasting money on useless tools, that money could have been spent on your employees in the  form of compensation. Like I said, EY is really focused on attempting to look as though value is being created when in fact it is not. 
5. Lots of meetings. Appearances are very important.
6. Employees on global 360 accounts get better treatment.
7. Some employees (executives mostly) tend to overemphasize how important this work is. Let's face it, if it was really glorious work then we would have action figures. 
8. Looks are very important. Seriously, if you are a girl, you will get promoted based on how hot you are (the quality of your work is largely unimportant). If you are a guy, you are treated a little better but there is still a sexist undercurrent in the environment. This is advice you won't get from HR obviously, but that doesn't mean it isn't true.
8.  You will be forced to eat hours.
9. Your ethical compass will start to get weaker.
10. You will get a little cynical.
11. Lots of driving and travel.
12. ""Family men"" and married couples with children are more likely to be promoted. If you want to be a partner, you have to be married (few exceptions).
13. You will work on vacations.
14. Loss of relationships with family and friends.
15. Some backstabbing and credit-stealing (but not very common).
16. Comp is below market but that's to be expected.
17. Employee retention is not something management is interested in. This makes you replaceable and expendable (yes even as a manager, unless you have been ""designated"" as a high performer by the partner group).",5.0,Carmine Di  Sibio,Global Chairman and CEO,451.0,95.0,https://media.glassdoor.com/people/sqll/2784/ey-ceo1567010297056.png,,,
